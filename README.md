# AquaInsight : Data-Visualisation-Tool-SIH-22

This winning project was developed during Smart India Hackathon 2022 for Central Ground Water Board PS-RK114

Idea Description :

We developed a web-interface with a searchable database categorising data state and yearwise respectively. Along with it we also developed a data visualization tool using tableau showcasing the data in form of a map and graphs.One of the main concern of the organisation was the representation of data highlighting the details of ground water in various aquifers and river basins and its interpretation.Understanding their requirements we depicted the complete data through a spatial map with two different layers representing the data of both the aquifers and river basins respectively. We also depicted the local and global meteoric water lines of various sites in India.We also ensured the security of data by providing a login panel allowing access to the authorised organization personnels only.

Innovative Idea Solution :

We merged the existing web and app development technologies with pre existing data visualization tool like Tableau to form a hybrid solution customized to our organization’s needs. Our solution would help fulfilling the concerned organization and the ministry’s prime requirement of a data visualization tool for the very fine detailed data that it collects through surveys & research expeditions.It would thus facilitate with that crucial data’s effective interpretation, and usage by the Central Ground Water Board; and enable data analysis.The solution also comprises of the searchable database which was mentioned as another gap-to-be-filled by the organization, thus also serving as a centralised dynamic library for the organization. 

Reference Architecture / Solution Architecture :

The application has used MySQL and PHP for user database creation and management to provide data security.HTML, JavaScript & CSS, Bootstrap 5 are used for the website’s Frontend Development. Google Maps API,Tableau and Mapbox were used for the creation of maps.Graphical Data Visualization of the provided groundwater isotope data was done using Tableau.

Technology Stack:

Frontend : HTML, CSS, Javascript
Backend: Tableau, API, MySQL, PHP, Mapbox, Bootstrap 5
